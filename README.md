# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
The State Board of Education has reviewed the original testing data and is concerned the 9th graders at Thomas High School have dishonest test practices. The board would like to re-examine the data with Thomas High School 9th grade results removed.


## Results

-Overall the district summary changed only minimally. The budget and total students of the district remain the same. The average math score changing only by 0.1 and the average reading score staying the same. The percentage passing math and reading went down minimally as well. Finally the overall passing percentage fell only 0.3%.
-The changes when looking specifically at Thomas High School are somewhat more apparent although changes again remain marginal.
-As the changes are minimal, Thomas High School maintained its 2nd place standing throughout the district. 
-Because of this, the differences in the various categories were marginal when averaged over the district by grade, school size, spending, or type.


## Summary
Four noticable changes were Thomas High School having no scores for 9th grade (listed as NaN), the average math score at the district level changed by 0.1%, the percentage of reading and math decreased minimally, and the overall passing percentage fell by 0.3%.
Overall, despite the miniam lchanges to the district wide totals, concerns for dishonest test taking practices in one grade at a location warrant further investigation and thoughtful planning for future testing to maintain the integrity of the exams.
